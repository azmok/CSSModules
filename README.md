# Intro
This package concept is inspired by [CSSModules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). or [React.js](https://reactjs.org). That is, "CSS and HTML Element is one Component". And in addition, I've been thinking that visual element and some UI element is also "components", color, layout, language, ...etc.

This concept is derived from CSSModules and React.js and Unix Philosophy, "[Modularity](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html)".

As for design, this package's typographical design(typography, space, layout, ...etc) is inspired by [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css).
