# Intro
This package concept is inspired by [CSSModules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). or [React.js](https://reactjs.org). That is, "CSS and HTML Element is an one Component". And in addition, I've been thinking that visual element and some UI element is also "components", color, layout, language, ...etc.

This concept is derived from CSSModules and React.js and Unix Philosophy, "[Modularity](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html)".

As for design, this package's typographical design(typography, space, layout, ...etc) is inspired by [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css).

# What for?
For Japanes developers wrting articles or managing bloging website without hussle for css design.

# Why?
- Global Japanese developer uses both English and Japanese when creating tutorial for Japanese novice, but in design point of view, English charactor is smaller than Japanese and it is unbalance, unorganized layout for me.
- When web designing, typography and related css styling is crutial for comfortable reading without any disruption that ugly layout or unbalanced coloring gave to readers.
- I want simple, minimal css styled design when writing article for programming. Non-styled, uncomfortable css styling made me feel bad when writing, too.
- Font face and line-height, letter-spacing, word-spacing, other spacing have strong relationship for comfortable visual design. So, I think one font face must stick to one line-heigh, letter-spacing and so on.
