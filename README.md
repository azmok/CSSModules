# Intro
This package is inspired by [CSSModules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).
Thanks to extremely useful package and concept for all developers!XD


This package concept is inspired by CSS Modules or React.js. That is, "CSS and HTML Element is one Component". And in addition, I've been thinking that visual element and some intnsible eleemnt is also "comonents", color, layout, language, ...etc.

This concept is derived from CSSModules and React.js and Unix Philosophy, "[Modularity](http://www.linfo.org/unix_philosophy.html)".

As for design, this package's typographical design(typography, space, layout, ...etc) is inspired by [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css).
